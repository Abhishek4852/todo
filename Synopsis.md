# **Synopsis: Advanced React To-Do Application with API Integration**

## **1. Introduction**
This document provides a detailed synopsis of the **Advanced React To-Do Application with API Integration**, designed as an assessment for frontend training. The project evaluates candidates' proficiency in foundational web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) along with React, Redux, and API integration. The application enhances a basic To-Do list by incorporating external API data, state management with Redux, and a responsive UI.

---

## **2. Objectives**
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Frontend Development & API Integration**: Utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+) to create an interactive To-Do application. Integrate with an external API (e.g., weather API) for contextual data.
2. **React Components & Advanced State Management**: Implement functional components using React hooks and manage global state using Redux with asynchronous actions handled by Redux Thunk or Saga.
3. **User Authentication**: Implement a mock authentication system to restrict access to tasks based on user login status.
4. **Responsiveness & UX/UI**: Ensure a seamless user experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
5. **Data Persistence**: Use local/session storage to maintain tasks across browser sessions.

---

## **3. System Requirements**
### **Frontend Development**
- HTML for page structure.
- CSS (or frameworks like Bootstrap/Material-UI) for styling.
- JavaScript (ES6+) for application logic.
- API integration for fetching and displaying external data.
- Error handling for API requests.

### **React Components & State Management**
- Functional components with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- Two core components:
  - `TaskInput` (adds new tasks)
  - `TaskList` (displays task list)
- Redux for global state management.
- Redux Thunk/Saga for handling API calls asynchronously.

### **Authentication & Storage**
- Simulated login/logout functionality using Redux.
- Tasks are protected behind authentication.
- Data stored in local/session storage for persistence.

### **UI & Responsiveness**
- Mobile-first design approach.
- CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsiveness.
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes.

### **Functionality Overview**
- **Add Task**: Users input a task and submit via a button or Enter key.
- **View Tasks**: Tasks are listed with priority levels.
- **Delete Task**: Users can remove a task from the list.
- **Task Prioritization**: Tasks can be marked as High, Medium, or Low priority.
- **Persistent Storage**: Data remains intact even after a page refresh.
- **Authentication**: Only logged-in users can access their tasks.

## **4. System Design**
The system follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern with **Redux-based state management**.
